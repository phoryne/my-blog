Greetings and welcome to the first article in an exciting new series. In this article, we’ll be talking about Microsoft, its cloud computing platform, some technical explanations, and the development of a culture that you’ll carry with you throughout all of my future blog posts. If you know Microsoft, then you surely know the company’s cloud computing platform. I’m talking about Azure. To ensure you fully grasp the purpose of these articles, know that every explanation will be as in-depth and detailed as possible to enable complete understanding.

Concretely, Microsoft Azure is a hyperscale public cloud built on a global network of interconnected data centers. A hyperscale public cloud refers to a public cloud infrastructure operated by a provider that can deploy computing resources on a massive scale, in a highly automated and elastic way. In short, it’s essentially a public cloud, accessible to anyone, operating at an almost worldwide scale. In the context of cloud computing platforms such as Microsoft Azure, we’ll be talking about terms like services and even resources.

> Moreover, it’s important to know that there are several well-known cloud computing platforms provided by equally well-known multinational companies. For example, there’s AWS (Amazon Web Services) from Amazon, and there’s also GCP (Google Cloud Platform), which is Google’s official cloud computing platform.

To fully understand what Microsoft Azure is, and to avoid throwing around terms like "Cloud Computing" or "Services" without explanation, I’ll provide some clarity. A cloud computing platform is a software abstraction layer that orchestrates, exposes, and delivers virtualized and distributed computing resources over a network (most often the Internet), following standardized service models ([IaaS](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/cloud-computing-dictionary/what-is-iaas), [PaaS](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/cloud-computing-dictionary/what-is-paas), [SaaS](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/cloud-computing-dictionary/what-is-saas)). In fact, public cloud platforms such as AWS, GCP, or Microsoft Azure are generally deployed over the Internet to ensure proper accessibility.

Concretely, cloud computing service models represent the different ways a cloud provider makes its resources available to users. Each model corresponds to a different level of abstraction and defines how responsibilities are divided between the provider and the client. The three most well-known models are IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS, with more specialized variations such as [FaaS](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/faas), [CaaS](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/containers-as-a-service), or [DBaaS](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/dbaas).
