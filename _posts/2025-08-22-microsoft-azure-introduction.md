## Introduction

Hey, for my first article, I wanted to start with a series of articles that I’ve been passionate about for quite some time now. This article marks the beginning of a long series on the study of Microsoft Azure, Microsoft’s cloud computing platform. For this first article, we’ll take a global look at what Microsoft Azure is and the world of cloud environments. Why? Well, because in future articles, I’ll dive deeper into certain concepts related to Azure, across different domains, in a detailed and technical way. This is one of the reasons why I suggest you make sure to properly understand all the concepts in this article. Without them, you may have trouble following the rest of the series (unless you’re already a Microsoft expert). I hope you’ll enjoy it and, without further ado, let’s get started.

Before we begin, I need to give you a quick heads-up. In this article, we’ll only be covering topics directly related to Microsoft Azure. Therefore, I suggest you at least have some basic knowledge and understanding of what cloud computing platforms are (since this is not the central focus of the article), how they work, and some familiarity with the related concepts.

## What is Microsoft Azure?

Microsoft Azure, formerly known as Windows Azure, is a cloud computing platform developed by Microsoft. It was officially announced in October 2008 under the name Windows Azure during the Microsoft Professional Developers Conference (PDC). The platform was later made publicly available in February 2010. In March 2014, Windows Azure was renamed Microsoft Azure, to reflect its broader focus beyond Windows and toward a more comprehensive cloud offering. If you happen to be living in a cave, reading this article on a scrap of paper, without internet access, and without having kidnapped a Microsoft employee to keep you company, the project’s logo looks like a stylized light-blue "A". There are other well-known cloud computing platforms as well. To give you an idea, there’s AWS (Amazon Web Services) from Amazon, GCP (Google Cloud Platform) from Google, and Azure from Microsoft. All three solutions offer more or less the same types of services and work in roughly the same way, the main difference being that they come from three different companies.

What is interesting to know are the figures provided by Microsoft. They actually offer more than 200 products spread across their available services. We will have the opportunity to discuss this later in the article. Moreover, they claim to provide their services to over 95% of the Fortune 500 multinational companies. What Microsoft Azure offers is a solution that enables companies using its various services to migrate from their on-premises infrastructures to fully cloud-based solutions, or to hybrid infrastructures (cloud + on-premises).
