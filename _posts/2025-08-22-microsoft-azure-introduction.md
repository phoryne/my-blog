## Introduction

### What is Cloud Computing?

Today, the world of cloud computing has become, or is gradually becoming, indispensable for certain individuals and businesses. From local small and medium-sized enterprises to multinational corporations, every kind of organization, whether small or large, actively uses or has already used services offered by cloud computing platforms. In practical terms, cloud computing is the delivery of computing services, including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence, over the internet ('the cloud') to provide faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale. With this model, you typically pay only for the cloud services you use, which helps reduce operating costs, run infrastructure more efficiently, and scale as your business needs evolve. With this term, we come to the concept of cloud computing platforms. These platforms make it possible to provide such services, giving access to products directly over the internet (mostly). In fact, many companies today choose either to fully migrate their on-premises infrastructure to cloud solutions, or to adopt what is known as a hybrid infrastructure. Why? For several fundamental and fairly straightforward reasons. Migrating to cloud or hybrid solutions allows companies to reduce costs and gain financial flexibility. Instead of making large upfront investments in servers, licenses, and data centers (capital expenditure), companies move to a pay-as-you-go model (operational expenditure). This shift is often referred to as moving from CapEx to OpEx.

> CapEx refers to long-term investments in physical assets, such as buildings, machinery, or equipment, that will benefit the company over several years. And OpEx refers to short-term operational costs necessary for the day-to-day functioning of the business, such as salaries, rent, and utilities.

Indeed, paying for expensive solutions that are only moderately used is neither practical nor cost-effective, as it results in wasted money. On the other hand, a pay-as-you-go model significantly reduces costs and keeps them under control. In fact, it helps avoid underutilization (servers running half empty) as well as overcapacity (purchasing hardware in advance). Next, what users of these solutions are looking for is scalability and elasticity. This simply means having the ability to scale capacity up or down depending on demand, seasonal peaks, product launches, or even crisis periods. Another major advantage is that provisioning time in the cloud is drastically reduced compared to on-premises (a few minutes in the cloud versus several weeks or months on site). There is also a growing need for innovation and speed. With the cloud, companies gain direct access to advanced managed services such as artificial intelligence, big data, and the Internet of Things (IoT). This makes rapid experimentation possible, as they can test new products or services without having to make heavy upfront investments in complex infrastructure. Another key factor is resilience and business continuity. Cloud infrastructures are often much more reliable thanks to their global redundancy. They also make it possible to implement disaster recovery solutions at a much more affordable cost than with a 100% on-premises setup. From a security and compliance perspective, hyperscalers (AWS, Azure, GCP) provide a high level of protection through encryption, advanced monitoring, and international certifications. With hybrid architectures, organizations can keep certain sensitive data on-premises (for example in banking, healthcare, or the public sector) while still leveraging the power of the cloud for the rest. The cloud is also a major enabler of agility and the adoption of DevOps practices. It integrates seamlessly with modern approaches such as continuous integration, continuous deployment, microservices, and Kubernetes. This fosters collaboration between teams and significantly reduces the time to market for new applications. Finally, we should not overlook global access and mobility. Cloud solutions allow employees and customers to access applications from anywhere in the world with low latency. This is a crucial advantage in the context of remote work or for companies with international subsidiaries. And for use cases that still require ultra-low latency, specialized hardware, or strict regulatory compliance, hybrid models allow organizations to combine the best of both worlds: keeping on-premises infrastructure where necessary while benefiting from the flexibility of the cloud.
