## Introduction

Greetings, in this article we will be talking about Microsoft, the cloud, its services and products, and a general understanding of how Microsoft Azure and its offerings work. This is not a technical article, but rather an informative one about how Microsoft Cloud has evolved over the years and the range of services it provides. And no, this article is not sponsored by Microsoft.

### What is Cloud Computing?

Today, the world of cloud computing has become, or is gradually becoming, indispensable for certain individuals and businesses. From local small and medium-sized enterprises to multinational corporations, every kind of organization, whether small or large, actively uses or has already used services offered by cloud computing platforms. In practical terms, cloud computing is the delivery of computing services, including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence, over the internet ('the cloud') to provide faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale. With this model, you typically pay only for the cloud services you use, which helps reduce operating costs, run infrastructure more efficiently, and scale as your business needs evolve. With this term, we come to the concept of cloud computing platforms. These platforms make it possible to provide such services, giving access to products directly over the internet (mostly). In fact, many companies today choose either to fully migrate their on-premises infrastructure to cloud solutions, or to adopt what is known as a hybrid infrastructure. Why? For several fundamental and fairly straightforward reasons. Migrating to cloud or hybrid solutions allows companies to reduce costs and gain financial flexibility. Instead of making large upfront investments in servers, licenses, and data centers (capital expenditure), companies move to a pay-as-you-go model (operational expenditure). This shift is often referred to as moving from CapEx to OpEx.

> CapEx refers to long-term investments in physical assets, such as buildings, machinery, or equipment, that will benefit the company over several years. And OpEx refers to short-term operational costs necessary for the day-to-day functioning of the business, such as salaries, rent, and utilities.

Indeed, paying for expensive solutions that are only moderately used is neither practical nor cost-effective, as it results in wasted money. On the other hand, a pay-as-you-go model significantly reduces costs and keeps them under control. In fact, it helps avoid underutilization (servers running half empty) as well as overcapacity (purchasing hardware in advance). Next, what users of these solutions are looking for is scalability and elasticity. This simply means having the ability to scale capacity up or down depending on demand, seasonal peaks, product launches, or even crisis periods. Another major advantage is that provisioning time in the cloud is drastically reduced compared to on-premises (a few minutes in the cloud versus several weeks or months on site). There is also a growing need for innovation and speed. With the cloud, companies gain direct access to advanced managed services such as artificial intelligence, big data, and the Internet of Things (IoT). This makes rapid experimentation possible, as they can test new products or services without having to make heavy upfront investments in complex infrastructure. Another key factor is resilience and business continuity. Cloud infrastructures are often much more reliable thanks to their global redundancy. 

They also make it possible to implement disaster recovery solutions at a much more affordable cost than with a 100% on-premises setup. From a security and compliance perspective, hyperscalers (AWS, Azure, GCP) provide a high level of protection through encryption, advanced monitoring, and international certifications. It is also important to note that there are several cloud computing platforms. For example, AWS (Amazon Web Services) from Amazon, GCP (Google Cloud Platform) from Google, and Azure from Microsoft. Below, you can see them presented with a few key terms.

With hybrid architectures, organizations can keep certain sensitive data on-premises (for example in banking, healthcare, or the public sector) while still leveraging the power of the cloud for the rest. The cloud is also a major enabler of agility and the adoption of DevOps practices. It integrates seamlessly with modern approaches such as continuous integration, continuous deployment, microservices, and Kubernetes. This fosters collaboration between teams and significantly reduces the time to market for new applications. Finally, we should not overlook global access and mobility. Cloud solutions allow employees and customers to access applications from anywhere in the world with low latency. This is a crucial advantage in the context of remote work or for companies with international subsidiaries. And for use cases that still require ultra-low latency, specialized hardware, or strict regulatory compliance, hybrid models allow organizations to combine the best of both worlds: keeping on-premises infrastructure where necessary while benefiting from the flexibility of the cloud.

### Overview of Microsoft Azure

As you may have guessed, Microsoft Azure is a cloud computing platform. In fact, it is Microsoft’s own cloud computing offering. Launched in 2010, marked a pivotal shift from on-premises datacenters to cloud computing. By offering businesses a global network of datacenters maintained and managed by Microsoft, Azure reduced the time and expense associated with maintaining on-premises infrastructure. Since its original launch, Azure continues to offer extensive capabilities that go beyond simplifying infrastructure management. With comprehensive AI, data, and application services that work together, Azure delivers a unified approach to cloud computing that’s unique in the industry. Its open, flexible cloud platform is designed to support each company’s business strategy and stage of AI transformation.

> Microsoft Azure has never stopped growing. In fact, it now offers more than 200 products across various services, and according to Microsoft, over 95% of Fortune 500 companies use, or have already used, its platform.

Azure stands out first and foremost through its natural integration with the Microsoft ecosystem. For companies already using Windows Server, Active Directory, SQL Server, Office 365, or Dynamics, the transition to Azure is much smoother. Identity management, for instance, is simplified through Azure Active Directory, avoiding the need to rebuild complex governance models and enabling organizations to capitalize on their existing systems. Another major strength of Azure lies in its hybrid and multicloud strategy. With solutions such as Azure Arc, Azure Stack, and Azure VMware Solution, organizations can manage both their cloud and on-premises infrastructures from a single platform. This is particularly reassuring for companies that must retain certain workloads on-premises for performance, security, or compliance reasons, while still benefiting from the flexibility of the cloud.

Azure also distinguishes itself with its extensive global coverage. Microsoft operates one of the largest datacenter networks worldwide, ensuring low latency and high availability across the globe. On top of that, Azure places a strong emphasis on regulatory compliance, offering more certifications than any other provider, making it a preferred choice for regulated industries such as healthcare, banking, and the public sector. Innovation in data and artificial intelligence is another key focus area. With services such as Azure Machine Learning, Cognitive Services, and Azure OpenAI Service, companies gain access to powerful tools for leveraging AI. On the data side, Azure offers solutions like Synapse Analytics, Cosmos DB, and native integration with Databricks, making it a robust platform for big data and real-time projects.

Finally, Azure places strong emphasis on security and centralized management. Through Microsoft Defender for Cloud and Sentinel, organizations benefit from advanced threat detection and response capabilities. Integration with Microsoft 365 further strengthens this unified security approach, extending from endpoints to cloud resources. Combined with a developer-friendly environment, featuring .NET, Visual Studio, GitHub, and a vast marketplace of solutions, it becomes clear why Azure continues to attract so many organizations.

## Azure Fundamentals

In this section, we will explore the key concepts of Microsoft Azure. We will go over the different terminologies the platform uses for its services, products, security measures, and more.

### Core Concepts and Terminology

In Azure, the first essential concept is the resource. A resource is an individual element that you create and use in the cloud. This could be a virtual machine (VM), an SQL database, a storage account, a serverless function, or a virtual network. Each resource represents a tangible component of the infrastructure or application. These resources are organized within Resource Groups. A resource group is a logical container that brings together multiple resources related to the same project or environment. For example, you can place all the resources needed for a web application (VM, database, storage) into a single group. This makes management, cost tracking, and even deletion easier, since an entire group can be removed with a single action. Resources and resource groups belong to a Subscription. An Azure subscription is tied to a billing agreement and an administrative entity. It defines the relationship between an organization and Microsoft, and it allows the separation of environments (e.g., one subscription for production and another for testing). Above the subscription level are Management Groups. These allow organizations to structure multiple subscriptions within the enterprise. They are mainly used to apply global rules (security policies, governance, compliance) across all subscriptions and resources.

Another fundamental concept is Regions and Availability Zones. A region is a specific geographic area (for example, France Central, West Europe, or East US) where Azure operates datacenters. Availability Zones are sets of independent datacenters within a region, designed to ensure high availability and protect against physical failures.The deployment and management of all these resources are handled through Azure Resource Manager (ARM). ARM is the management layer that enables automated deployments, standardized configurations, and consistent resource management. Thanks to ARM, infrastructure-as-code can be implemented via ARM templates, Bicep, or even Terraform. Finally, identity and access management is a central pillar in Azure. This is handled by Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), which manages users, groups, roles, and access to resources. A key concept here is Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), which allows precise permissions (read, write, administer) to be assigned across different scopes: a single resource, a resource group, a subscription, or even a management group.
