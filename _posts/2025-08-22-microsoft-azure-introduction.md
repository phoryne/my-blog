## Introduction

Today, the world of cloud computing has become, or is gradually becoming, indispensable for certain individuals and businesses. From local small and medium-sized enterprises to multinational corporations, every kind of organization, whether small or large, actively uses or has already used services offered by cloud computing platforms. In practical terms, cloud computing is the delivery of computing services, including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence, over the internet ('the cloud') to provide faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale. With this model, you typically pay only for the cloud services you use, which helps reduce operating costs, run infrastructure more efficiently, and scale as your business needs evolve. With this term, we come to the concept of cloud computing platforms. These platforms make it possible to provide such services, giving access to products directly over the internet (mostly). In fact, many companies today choose either to fully migrate their on-premises infrastructure to cloud solutions, or to adopt what is known as a hybrid infrastructure. Why? For several fundamental and fairly straightforward reasons. Migrating to cloud or hybrid solutions allows companies to reduce costs and gain financial flexibility. Instead of making large upfront investments in servers, licenses, and data centers (capital expenditure), companies move to a pay-as-you-go model (operational expenditure). This shift is often referred to as moving from CapEx to OpEx.

> CapEx refers to long-term investments in physical assets, such as buildings, machinery, or equipment, that will benefit the company over several years. And OpEx refers to short-term operational costs necessary for the day-to-day functioning of the business, such as salaries, rent, and utilities.

Indeed, paying for expensive solutions that are only moderately used is neither practical nor cost-effective, as it results in wasted money. On the other hand, a pay-as-you-go model significantly reduces costs and keeps them under control. In fact, it helps avoid underutilization (servers running half empty) as well as overcapacity (purchasing hardware in advance).
