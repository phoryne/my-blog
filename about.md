Iâ€™m an 18-year-old passionate about computer science, fascinated by the inner workings of information systems. My main interests revolve around understanding complex architectures, designing innovative solutions, and exploring security mechanisms.

Beyond technology, I find inspiration in snowy landscapes and the vastness of our world, which constantly reminds me how much there is to explore and learn. Through this blog, I share my journey, insights, and reflections on both computing and curiosity-driven discovery.
